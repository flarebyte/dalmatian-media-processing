# Maintenance of the code

## Overall workflow

The typical developer workflow goes as follow:

| Mode                   | Code analysis | Testing                    | Building     | Publishing                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Checking               | yarn lint     | yarn test or yarn test:cov | yarn build   | yarn ready and yarn release:check |
| Fixing                 | yarn lint:fix | yarn test:fix              | Fix the code | Update dependencies and yarn doc  |
| Continuous integration | yarn lint:ci  | yarn test:ci               | yarn build   | bpub                              |
